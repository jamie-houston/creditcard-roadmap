## Create a credit card roadmap
Add your cards
- [ ] User can be logged in or anonymous.  
	- [ ] If logged in, everything is stored in the user's profile between logins/sessions.
	- [ ] If logged out, everything is stored in the session but if they load the website in a different devices or time it won't be there.
- [ ] You can select a card from the ones on the site and they're stored in the user's credit cards.
- [ ] For each card the user selects
	- [ ] They can specify the date they got the card
	- [ ] Update the bonus if it's different.  This won't affect the cards in the system that other's see, but will be stored for that user.
	- [ ] Specify if the bonus earned (they spent the minimum spend amount)
- [ ] It isn't included in suggested cards
- [ ] Let them add a card if it's not in the system and admin can approve or edit it
Roadmap
- [ ] User can see what card to use for what categories if they've selected cards.
Recommendations
- [ ] System will tell them which card(s) to cancel and when.
	- [ ] If they've earned the bonus and have another card with a higher reward percentage, or that requires spending to get the bonus, they should use that card.
- [ ] Which cards to get and when
	- [ ] If the user has 2 recommend card that requires 3,000 in spending for the bonus, they should apply for the first card now, and the second card after they've spent the minimum spend.  If they spend 1,500/month, then they should get the 2nd card after 2 months.
- [ ] Show user based on how much they spend, when you'll hit the bonus limit
- [ ] Based on policies for various issuers
	- [ ] recommendation for next card will include current cards
	- [ ] example - Chase 5/24 - they can only apply for 5 cards from Chase Issuer within 24 months.
	- [ ] This will only apply if they specify when they opened the account (for chase 5/24)
